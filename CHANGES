This is a copy of GNU ed 1.5 with the following changes:
- It's translated into Lua
- Patterns for search and replace are Lua 5.1 patterns (as used in string.match
  and string.gsub)
- Doesn't implement undo
- Doesn't implement any command line flags, including "-G: traditional mode"
- Doesn't implement shell escapes or piping lines to/from shell commands
- Fixes a bug: "e foo\nr words\nq\n" should say "Buffer modified"
- Contents of yank buffer remain when editing a different file
- when numbering lines ("g/foo/n") we indent all continuation lines
  to match the indentation of the first
